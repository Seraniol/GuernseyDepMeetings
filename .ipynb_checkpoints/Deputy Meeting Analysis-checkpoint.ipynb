To  the  Members  of  the  States  of the  Island  of \\nGuernsey, I hereby give notice that a meeting of the States of Deliberation will be held at The Royal \\nCourt  House  on  Friday,  16th  October  2020  immediately  after  the  sitting  of  the  Royal  Court  to \\nconsider the item contained in this Billet d'État – Election of a President of the Policy & Resources \\nCommittee. \\n \\n \\n \\nWelcome and congratulations \\nto newly elected Members of the Assembly \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Well, Members of the States, it is a great pleasure for me to address you collectively \\nin that fashion for the first time, to welcome you to this new Assembly, and to congratulate each of \\nyou who has recently been elected as People’s Deputies to serve until June 2025 and to welcome \\nback the two Alderney Representatives. \\nAs the Preamble to the Rules of Procedure explains, parliamentary and governing functions are \\nfused in one body, the States of Deliberation, and as you start this new term of the Assembly, I am \\nquietly confident that those who have elected you will hope that you will govern collaboratively and \\nso effectively and efficiently, and for my part I wish you well in your endeavours in the coming term. \\nBefore we move into the election of a President of the Policy & Resources Committee, I think \\nthat recognising that the General Election just over a week ago was a first for Guernsey and that it \\ninvolved  a  real  team  effort  to  deliver  it,  led  by  the  Registrar  General  of  Electors  and  the  Central \\nReturning Officer, but also including the polling station officers as well as those who assisted them \\nas volunteers, along with others who I might describe as being on the payroll, I invite you now to \\njoin with me in the customary fashion to thank the whole team who enabled this to happen for a \\njob really well done. (Applause) \\nThank you, Members of the States. \\n \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n5 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBillet d'État XIX \\nPOLICY & RESOURCES COMMITTEE \\nI. Election of a President of the Policy & Resources Committee – \\nDeputy Peter Ferbrache elected \\n \\nArticle I. \\nThe States are asked: \\nTo elect a sitting Member of the States as President of the Policy & Resources Committee to serve \\nuntil  30th  June  2025  in  accordance  with  Rule  16  of  The  Rules  of  Procedure  of  the  States  of \\nDeliberation, as set out in Section 1 of The Rules of Procedure of the States of Deliberation and \\ntheir Committees. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: So I am now going to invite Members who wish to do so to propose a candidate for \\nthe position of President of the Policy & Resources Committee. Those who wish to do so please \\nrise.  \\nDeputy Dudley-Owen. \\n \\nDeputy Dudley-Owen: I wish to propose Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Thank you very much.  \\nIs that nomination seconded? \\n \\nDeputy Prow: Yes, sir. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Prow. \\nDeputy Roffey. \\n \\nDeputy Roffey: Sir, I wish to propose Deputy Gavin St Pier. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Is that nomination seconded? \\n \\nDeputy Cameron: Yes, sir. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Thank you very much, Deputy Cameron. \\nAre there any further nominations? No. \\nOkay, on that basis we have the two candidates: Deputy Ferbrache proposed by Deputy Dudley-\\nOwen and seconded by Deputy Prow; and Deputy St Pier proposed by Deputy Roffey and seconded \\nby Deputy Cameron. \\nIn a moment I am going to invite the two candidates to come up and take their places here on \\nthe  Bench  and  that  will  be  in  alphabetical  order  and  in  order  of  nomination  as  it  turns  out,  so \\nDeputy Ferbrache to my right and Deputy St Pier to my left. \\nThere will then, as you know from looking at Rule 16, be a period of speeches. First the proposer \\nof Deputy Ferbrache will speak and then Deputy Ferbrache, the candidate will speak. Then Deputy \\nRoffey as the proposer of Deputy St Pier will speak, followed by Deputy St Pier, the candidate. \\nWhat I am going to do is adopt what happened just over four years ago in 2016, and that is to \\nask those who wish to pose questions … There will then be a 30-minute period of questions to the \\ncandidates  where  they  answer  those  questions  alternately,  but  we  reverse  who  answers  first \\nbetween each question. \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n6 \\n25 \\n30 \\n35 \\n40 \\n45 \\n50 \\n55 \\n60 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nI am going to ask those who wish to pose a question to write their name on the voting slip that \\nthey have got in front of them and that will then be collected up and we will put them in my toque \\nand draw them out randomly, rather me having the invidious choice of choosing who to invite to \\nask a question.  \\nThose questions have to be questions on a matter of policy relating to the mandate of the Policy \\n&  Resources  Committee.  If  it  is  a  question  outside  of  the  mandate,  then  I  am  afraid  that  I  will \\npotentially rule it out of order. \\nI hope that is sufficiently clear because once the question time is completed, we will then go to \\nthe vote, which is when you take your voting slips and write the name of the candidate you wish to \\nsee elected as the new President of the Policy & Resources Committee on to it. \\nMadam Procureur, is there anything I might have missed? \\n \\nThe Procureur: Sir, I very much doubt that, I am sure. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: So what I am going to do next is to invite the two candidates, Deputy Ferbrache and \\nDeputy St Pier, to make their way round to join us on the Bench, please. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache and Deputy St Pier took their seats. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Gentlemen, if you are both ready and comfortable, then what I will do is I will invite \\nthe  proposer  of  Deputy  Ferbrache,  Deputy  Dudley-Owen  to  put  the  nomination  for  up  to  five \\nminutes. \\nDeputy Dudley-Owen. \\n \\nDeputy Dudley-Owen: Thank you, sir. \\nThis is a momentous day at the beginning of this new term where we will elect a President of \\nPolicy & Resources Committee. Four years ago, in May 2016, a newcomer to the States of Guernsey, \\nI never imagined myself commending a heavyweight of the Guernsey political scene to the States \\nof  Deliberation  for  this  principal  role  to  lead  our  Government.  Today,  sir,  I  am  proposing \\nDeputy Peter Ferbrache as the President of the Committee for Policy & Resources. \\nI have worked under the leadership of both candidates and on a personal level I have warmed \\nto each as individuals. They are different characters. It is to Deputy Ferbrache that I owe much of \\nthe political confidence which I have now, enabling me to make this important commendation. \\nAs a Member of the Committee for Economic Development, Deputy Ferbrache was my President \\nfor nearly two years. It was there I saw first-hand how he was able to easily put his trust in people, \\nempowering them to succeed.  \\nDeputy  Ferbrache  and  I  have  not  always  been  aligned  on  policy  but  in  Committee  he  openly \\nencouraged  me  and  our  colleagues  to  challenge,  to  question,  debate  and  explore  our  views,  to \\nensure our decisions were well informed, made by consensus, if not unanimous. \\nHe respected the capability of each of his Committee Members and by delegating specific policy \\narea  responsibility  to  each  of  us  he  encouraged  individuals  to  establish  ownership  and  personal \\ninvestment  in  important  areas  of  the  mandate,  whilst  never  side-stepping  or  abdicating  his  own \\naccountability or responsibility as President of the Committee. \\nDeputy  Ferbrache  enabled  me  to  find  my  niche,  to  develop  my  knowledge,  to  carve  out \\nspecialisms  in  the  States  and  to  lead  in  those  areas.  He  enabled  me  to  find  my  confidence  and \\nbecome an effective politician in the States of Guernsey. \\nHe was then, as he is now, a facilitator. He is known in business-speak as a servant leader and \\nthis is just what Guernsey needs at this time as we exit what has undoubtedly been the most difficult \\ntime in our modern history since the end of the Second World War. This style of leadership is how \\nDeputy Ferbrache led as a President of Economic Development. This is how he has led more recently \\nas President of the States' Trading & Supervisory Board. \\n65 \\n70 \\n75 \\n80 \\n85 \\n90 \\n95 \\n100 \\n105 \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n7 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\n110 \\n115 \\nDespite a formidable professional reputation and a career leading him to be amongst the most \\nsuccessful legal eagles on the Island, Deputy Ferbrache does not seek to command and control, he \\ndoes not seek to divide and conquer, or use an authoritarian style of leadership.  \\nI have sought, sir, additional references for Deputy Ferbrache from non-States members, Stuart \\nFalla and John Hollis of STSB and they said: I found him to be incredibly inclusive. He listens intently \\nto the views of others before guiding STSB to a resolution. What is refreshing about Peter is that he \\nhas trusted people to get on with tasks, he listens and encourages, and delegates people to get on \\nwith  it.  He  is  very  constructive.  He  looks  to  get  problems  resolved  and  is  direct  and  open  in \\ncommunications. The mantra he has maintained is: every decision must be in the long-term interest \\nof the Island.’ \\nIt is clear from these comments that Deputy Ferbrache has skills which need to be brought to \\n120 \\nbear to unite our Assembly, to serve our Islanders in the best possible way.  \\n125 \\n130 \\n135 \\nFrom an underprivileged background in Guernsey, Peter has a deep understanding of problems \\npeople face in life in our small community. He grasped the opportunities presented to him along \\nthe way and reflecting on the achievements he made through his life he must surely be recognised \\nas an inspiration to many young people in Guernsey. \\nWe  face  challenges  ahead,  enhancing  the  wellbeing  of  our  community  in  terms  of  security, \\neducation,  health  and  social  equity,  enhancing  our  economic  and  competitive  edge  ensuring \\nGuernsey's autonomy is respected and maintained, delivering agreed projects and resolving those \\nwhich remain outstanding on which our future success relies. \\nThe President of P&R will need to guide the States forward collaboratively ensuring corporation \\nbetween  Committees  and  empowering  their  Presidents  to  deliver  their  respective  mandates.  We \\nhave  undergone  a  period  of  self-inflicted  economic  harm  in  order  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  the \\nCovid pandemic. We are still existing in  a bubble of safety whilst the outside world continues to \\nstruggle in and out of various degrees of lockdown. \\nDeputy Ferbrache will give us the effective leadership we need to heal the wounds of lockdown \\nto  work  through  recovery,  to  rebuild  a  sustainable  and  prosperous  future;  he  is  able  to  listen \\nattentively  with  empathy  and  react;  he  is  able  to  reason  and  persuade;  he  is  able  to  work \\ncollaboratively;  he  empowers  and  supports;  he  is  someone  who  invests  his  time  ensuring  the \\nsuccess of others; a servant leader shares their power, they out the needs of the team first; they \\nhelp people develop and perform as highly as possible.  \\n140 \\nGuernsey needs someone who will serve selflessly. Deputy Ferbrache will be the Island's servant \\nleader. \\n145 \\n150 \\n155 \\nI propose Deputy Ferbrache to the States as President of the Committee for Policy & Resources. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Dudley-Owen, I am afraid your five minutes is up there. \\nDeputy Ferbrache now has 10 minutes. Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Thank you very much, sir. \\nSir, it is a great honour and I am really indebted to Deputy Dudley-Owen for her comments. \\nThe  people  of  Guernsey,  the  people  of  the  Bailiwick,  need  action.  There  were  words  I  read \\nrecently  in  an  economic  journal  that  resonated  with  me  and  they  were:  enough  of  action  plans, \\nenough of strategies, enough of visions, what we need is – and the words are almost Churchillian \\nand that is a character I have rather admired in my life, which were – not action this week, not action \\nthis day, but action now. What we need to carry forward is action now, because people do not care \\ntoo much about visions. \\nBut I do have a vision myself and it is a vision that has always carried me through in my life, and \\nthat is however good or bad today is, tomorrow may be better; however good or bad next week is, \\nthe week after may be better; however good or bad next year is, next year may be better. It may \\nnot be and we have got to be concerned for the vicissitudes of life, for the turbulence that we have \\nfaced, and we faced two great challenges in the last States.  \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n8 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nWhen I was sworn in as a States’ Member on 30th April 2016 I had absolutely no idea that the \\npeople of Britain would decide to leave the EU some six or seven weeks later. That was a curved ball \\nas far as I was concerned. When I was watching my television set and actually eating a Chinese take-\\naway and looking at some far-off Chinese Province in January of this year, I had no idea that those \\nproblems would be visited upon the whole of the world just a couple of months later. \\nWhat people want is food on their table; what they want is a roof over their head; what they \\nwant are their children educated; what the old people want is security of their life; what we want \\nand we want our young to want is aspiration and hope. \\nNow, in my life, whether it is professional life, personal life, States life, I have made thousands of \\ndecisions, and quite a lot of those have been wrong – hopefully more have been right; well, people \\ncan tell and make that judgement themselves. But I have never been afraid to make decisions.  \\nWhat I want to rail back again is the soporific effect of the regulation that we seem to be saddled \\nwith and burdened with in this Island. I want us to be able to resolve, under I hope the very able \\nleadership of the person who just proposed me, our education questions very quickly, because what \\nwe did and our predecessor did as a States was to take down an education system without having \\nany idea what it was going to put in its place. That was an abrogation of responsibility. I do not \\nabrogate responsibility; I build on responsibility. \\nWhat I want to do, as somebody whose family have been here since Abraham was a boy and in \\nrelation to my four children and my seven grandchildren who all live here, but I want them to have \\na better life than I have had, and I have had a very good life, because of what Guernsey has done \\nfor me – this Island, which is a paradise in the world because we can speak to each other, we can \\nhave this meeting. If we were in the House of Commons there would be some of us on video link \\nfrom Scotland, others sitting 20 feet apart from each other. We can do that, and we can do that \\nbecause we are a sensible Island community.  \\nWe have always built on our opportunity and I do work – and I am grateful for Deputy Dudley-\\nOwen's  comments because it is  easy to say it yourself, but if somebody who has worked  closely \\nwith me and I considerably respect says it – I have always worked collaboratively because I have \\ngone into many meetings, whether it is a legal meeting, whether it is a political meeting or whatever, \\nwith  a  view,  I  think  this  is  a  view  and  sensible  intelligent  people  …  and  there  are  39  –  I  exclude \\nmyself – there are 39 intelligent sensible people that will be making decisions over the next four \\nyears and they have to persuade me you have got it wrong. Okay, I have got it wrong, I have got it \\nwrong, the only thing I would not get wrong is the support of the football team that I have, but that \\nis by the by – everybody else is wrong when they support something different. \\nBut  we  have  got  questions  to  resolve.  The  first  thing  we  are  going  to  have  to  resolve  is  our \\neconomy, because anybody that thinks that 97% of our economy is running efficiently is not living \\nin the real economic world. You say that to the hospitality trade where they are functioning at 30% \\nto 40% of efficiency. You say that to the construction industry where you cannot get a carpenter or \\na plumber for the next six months but you go beyond then, you go beyond the big projects, you \\nsay that to the finance sector that is already sotto voce letting people leave their employment, you \\nsay it to them. You say to them that we are booming and we are doing well, we are comparatively \\ndoing well.  \\nWhat we also must not do, because it is not a Guernsey thing to do otherwise, is borrow money \\nwithout a specific purpose. We must not borrow money unless (a) we can repay it and (b) we know \\nspecifically what we are going to use it for. \\nWhat  I  would  like  to  see  if  I  am  elected  in  relation  to  Policy  &  Resources  is  the  collaborative \\napproach that Deputy Dudley-Owen has mentioned. There are five Members, we will all be equal \\nMembers, we will all have responsibilities.  \\nWe  have  concentrated  in  the  past  on  the  Treasury  aspects  and  we  have  done  quite  well  in \\nrelation to that. Undoubtedly our Budget is balanced, undoubtedly we have got reserves, what we \\nhave not done so well in the last four years is deal with policy. I would separate the two as best I \\ncould.  \\n160 \\n165 \\n170 \\n175 \\n180 \\n185 \\n190 \\n195 \\n200 \\n205 \\n210 \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n9 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nExternal relations are going to be a real challenge for us in the future. We have seen an instance \\nof that just this week. There will be other ships that will be sailing with hostility towards our shores, \\nwe need to have strong people in to resist that. \\nYou  need  a  coalition  of  all  talents  and  people  who  may  not  necessarily  vote  for  me  in  this \\nparticular  contest  have  agreed  to  allow  their  names  to  be  nominated  and  I  will  just  name  two: \\nDeputy Le Tocq, who I respect considerably, I have worked with him on SACC; and Deputy Helyar \\nwho is new and will be a very bright addition to the States of Guernsey. Now in relation to them I \\nwould seek to supplement them by two other strong Members if I am elected. \\nBut  I  would  say  to  probably  Deputy  Le  Tocq  if  he  continued  to  agree  to  have  his  name  put \\nforward and he was elected carry on with external relations, very good job, we need you because \\nthat is such an important asset in fact over the next four years. \\nBut I would say to two Members, deal with Treasury – everybody will deal with everything in the \\nsense that people would be cohesive and deal with all kinds of things – but deal with Treasury. I \\nwould lead together with another colleague from Policy & Resources regular meetings with all the \\nother  Committee  Presidents,  the  six  Principal  Committees  and  what  I  regard  also,  having  been \\nPresident  for  the  last  two  and  a  quarter  years,  the  STSB  which  is  as  important  as  any  other \\nCommittee of the States of Guernsey. I would have monthly meetings with them. The door would \\nalways be open, we would try and have a cohesive balanced way of going forward because that has \\nbeen lacking. Again with no criticism of anybody, that has been lacking over the last four years. Not \\ngoing back to what happened eight years ago, or five or six years ago  – but by moving forward \\nbecause we need to more forward collaboratively. \\nIt  would  be  unrealistic  to  say  that  there  will  not  be  disagreements,  but  where  we  have  those \\ndisagreements we must do so civilly, in a balanced way and cohesively. We can get angry with each \\nother  today  but  we  must  be  friends  again  tomorrow,  because  we  have  to  move  forward  for  the \\nbenefit of this magnificent Bailiwick that we are all so fortunate to live in and we are all so fortunate \\nto serve. \\nI ask you to vote for me in this election, colleagues. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Thank you very much. \\nI now turn to the proposer of Deputy St Pier, Deputy Roffey, your five minutes. \\n \\nDeputy Roffey: Members, the choice we make today is absolutely crucial. It will set the tone for \\nthe next five years and go a long way to determining how successful this new Assembly can be. \\nOf  course  we  are  not  choosing  a  President  of  Guernsey.  Under  our  system  of  Government \\nexecutive  power  is  diffused,  but  undeniably  the  person  at  the  apex  of  policy  co-ordination  and \\nresource allocation has a huge impact, it is a genuine leadership role and it requires a States' person \\nto do it well. \\nNow perhaps as a proposer I should just be insisting that this is a really easy choice because my \\nman  is  head  and  shoulders  and  torso  above  the  rest  of  the  field.  He  is  indeed  just  that  when  it \\ncomes to ability, but I still accept that this decision is not straight forward, either for new Members \\nof for survivors of the last fractious and tribal Assembly.  \\nIf this election was only about political ability, then electing Deputy St Pier would be a no-brainer, \\nhis capability in many crucial areas of Government has been obvious for all to see over recent years.  \\nFirstly his forceful and proactive defence of Guernsey  when representing the Island externally \\nhas been a genuine tour de force. He has been far better in that role than any other political leader \\nthat I have seen in the States over the last 40 years, and going forward those talents are going to \\nbe sorely needed, the UK and EU are staggering towards the end of the Brexit transition, we have \\nseen the sort of individual problems that has flagged up in the last couple of days. \\nBut there is also a far bigger issue. Protocol 3 is about to disappear and when it does Guernsey \\nwill  be  more  exposed  to  external  forces  than  it  has  been  for  half  a  century,  there  could  be  no \\npossible worse time to dump our key proven, battle-hardened asset on the international stage. \\n215 \\n220 \\n225 \\n230 \\n235 \\n240 \\n245 \\n250 \\n255 \\n260 \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n10 \\n265 \\n270 \\n275 \\n280 \\n285 \\n290 \\n295 \\n300 \\n305 \\n310 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nMy  second  example  of  his  political  ability  is  the  way  he  took  the  structural  deficit  in  public \\nfinances created by Zero-10 and the global recession and slowly and painfully brought Guernsey's \\nBudget back into balance. Deputy St Pier may be socially liberal but financially he is a hard liner, \\nkeeping a scrooge like control of the public pursue. Now that may frustrate me personally at times \\nbut it is probably a good quality for the person in charge of our finances. \\nOf course that balanced Budget has been completely blown out of the water by Covid-19 but \\nthe  pandemic  has  also  shown  another  of  Deputy  St  Pier's  leadership  qualities.  His  calmness, \\njudgement and decisiveness in a crisis, qualities that are both rare and precious.  \\nSome people have said almost dismissively that the only reason he topped the poll by a huge \\nmargin was because of the way he had led the Island's response to the Covid-19 emergency. What \\nis their point? If his leadership in the crisis impressed the Island, surely that is a positive. Make no \\nmistake, that crisis is far from over. \\nSo having placed his obvious abilities why do I say this is not a straight forward  choice?  Two \\nreasons, the first flippant one is that he is not sufficiently like me, he is far too keen on borrowing, \\nsynchronisation and on process. So I do not claim that he is the perfect candidate, but frankly, sir, \\nif Members want perfection in their leader they are doomed to disappointment. \\nThe second more serious question I had to ask myself was this: does Deputy St Pier have the \\nqualities  needed  to  cure  the  damaging  tribalism  of  the  last  four  years?  I  cannot  be  honestly \\nabsolutely  sure,  but  I  do  know  two  things.  Firstly  that  changing  our  leader  is  no  guarantee  that \\nthings will get better in that respect, in fact they could get very much worse. Secondly Deputy St \\nPier seems receptive to my subtle hints over how he needs to change the leadership style, be a bit \\nless presidential and respect the Assembly a bit more – a bit of humility goes a long way and build \\nmore political bridges. \\nMaybe I am naïve but I have been round the fiscal block, I am not easily soft-soaped and I do \\nbelieve him. I genuinely regard him as the more likely candidate to build esprit de corps in this new \\nAssembly. If I did not, I would not be proposing him. Ability is one thing but we also need healing. \\nIn summary my candidate is not the perfect candidate, but he is the best on offer by a country \\nmile, and we would be daft not to elect him today.  \\nWe stand at too crucial a point in Guernsey's history not to choose the most able leader available \\nto us and that is definitely Gavin St Pier. Whether we personally like him or not is not the point. We \\nowe it to Guernsey at this point in our history to elect him. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Thank you very much. \\nI now turn to Deputy St Pier to speak. Deputy St Pier, your 10 minutes. \\n \\nDeputy St Pier: Wow, it is fantastic to see so many new faces at the dawn of this new era. Today \\nwe begin a journey together of four years and eight months, and it may be the most challenging \\nperiod to be in Government in a generation, but it is going to be so exciting. \\nWe will have policy disagreements undoubtedly, but it is such a privilege for me to be with you \\nas  part  of  the  team  that  can  and  I  believe  will  now  effect  change.  The  people  of  Guernsey  have \\nplaced their trust in each of us. Record numbers sorted their way through 118  candidates,  three \\nparties, a plethora of policies, personalities and promises and we are the result. \\nI truly believe that this a period of tremendous opportunity. We are in such a good place. We \\nexpect  our  economy  to  rebound  4.8%  next  year,  our  deficit  this  year  will  be  at  least  £37  million \\nbetter than forecast six months ago, and we have only needed to use £50 million or 25% of our \\nborrowing facility to manage our cash flows this year.  \\nWe need to be ambitious and drive hard and fast. We must deliver recovery from Covid at the \\nsame time as facing other major issues including of course the ongoing pandemic, climate change \\nand Brexit.  \\nBut we must be united because our challenges will not wait for us. Only this week I have been \\nfighting for our fishing industry, a strong business-driven economy is the backbone of this Island, \\nand  it  is  Government's  job  to  promote  prosperity  through  enterprise.  That  requires  supporting \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n11 \\n315 \\n320 \\n325 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nbalanced budgets through our essential low tax regime, but we must also drive economic growth. \\nLighter regulation alone will not be enough; we need investment and so like any growth business \\nwe should look at modest low interest borrowings, so long as they are never used to fund a deficit, \\nare strictly controlled by this Assembly, and are only undertaken to grow our economic capacity – \\nso for example funding the rapid roll-out of high speed broadband.  \\nWhilst  we  must  focus  on  economic  success,  we  must  also  understand  that  economic, \\nenvironment  and  social  policies  are  inherently  interconnected  with  each  other.  Recovery  of  our \\neconomy and community from the pandemic is our biggest and immediate challenge. This is the \\nmission we can and must unite around. \\nWe have a unique opportunity to restore the public's faith in Government and build upon the \\nconfidence  that  Government  earned  in  the  management  of  Covid.  That  requires  us  to  do  things \\nvery  differently  with  a  very  different  group  of  people.  We  need  to  trust  each  other  and  move \\nforward,  putting  the  squabbles  of  the  past  behind  us.  The  people  voted  for  an  apparently \\nparadoxical combination of change and experience. Like all of you, I was on the election trail, I have \\nlistened to that message in the last month and I have listened to you too in the last week. \\nI clearly provide the continuity and experience and now I will explain the role I will play in helping \\n330 \\nto deliver change with you over the days, weeks and months ahead.  \\n335 \\n340 \\n345 \\n350 \\n355 \\n360 \\nDay one: change will begin with me, I will lead from the front, I will begin tomorrow by building \\na very different P&R, I will draw talent and political thought from across the Assembly – and contrary \\nvoices in the room can be challenging, particularly for the Chair, but it does produce decisions that \\nare more robust. In the first instance I will invite Deputies Ferbrache, Soulsby and Helyar to join me \\nand together we will agree who the fifth nominee should be. \\nI would also like to consider how we get the voice of Alderney better heard because to deliver a \\nBailiwick recovery we must seize the opportunity created this year to work more closely together. \\nWeek one: we need more effective inter-Committee working and oversight of the Civil Service. \\nIn the first week I will ask one Member of P&R to become a political lead for the reform of the public \\nservice. I will ask other Members to provide political oversight of the senior civil servants working \\non inter-Committee policies. Those P&R Members will attend other Committees when relevant and \\ninvited to ensure that all the Committees’ policy development aligns with each other and is matched \\nwith  resources,  and  I  will  ask  another  Deputy  outside  P&R  to  take  a  lead  for  the  oversight  of \\nproperty,  meeting  quarterly  with  us  to  help  effectively  drive  the  maintenance,  strategic  use  and \\ndevelopment of the property portfolio. \\nMonth  one:  working  with  this  more  inclusive  structure  in  the  first  month,  I  will  initiate  the \\nfollowing five Covid revive actions:  \\nFirst,  working  with  Employment  &  Social  Security,  P&R  will  make  provision  in  the  Budget  for \\nemployer social security contribution holidays for businesses that create new jobs. \\nSecond, I will ask P&R to include additional funding in the 2021 Budget for Guernsey Finance. \\nNow is absolutely the time to invest and support the promotion of the financial services sector – \\nour key industry that has served us so well through lockdown. \\nThird, P&R will submit a policy letter to allow debate on strategic population policy and remove \\nthe red tape on the Open Market that was introduced with the Population Management Law. \\nFourth, we will expedite capital projects including repairs of the Fermain Wall, the Havelet Slip \\nand Clarence Battery by removing some of our own internal red tape procedures. To do this I will \\nask P&R to include Propositions in November's Budget. \\nFifth, we should tackle our overdue personal insolvency legislation which could be prioritised by \\nP&R for drafting, and P&R would also work with other Committees to ensure appropriate regulation \\nof the new cannabis-growing industry. \\nQuarter one: in the first 100 days P&R will work with Economic Development to submit proposals \\nto  the  Assembly  to  enable  the  rapid  roll-out  of  super-fast  broadband  and  will  also  submit  by \\n31st January  the  detailed  Revive  and  Thrive  action  plans,  including  for  example  proposals  to \\nprogress active travel, home energy efficiency schemes and environmental projects. \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n12 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\n365 \\n370 \\n375 \\nDeputy  Soulsby  led  a  requête  on  the  machinery  of  government  earlier  this  year.  It  was  never \\ndebated because there was so much else going on. I am going to ask Deputy Soulsby in the first \\n100 days to liaise with all Members to ascertain the appetite for effecting some of her ideas so that \\nwe can benefit from any changes for the rest of this term. \\nI  am  going  to  ask  the  Member  leading  on  behalf  of  P&R  as  employer  to  engage  with  all \\nMembers, particularly the nursing champions, to develop a common understanding of the issues \\nand options so that we can work together to deliver a solution for the nurses. \\nYear one: in the first year I will ensure P&R brings to this Assembly two major proposals. First, \\nwe must find a sustainable tax system following the comprehensive tax review. Second, we must \\nhave proposals to ensure Royal Assent for our legislation is given on Island through His Excellency \\nrather than in London through the Privy Council.  \\nIt is vital over this term that we actively engage with the UK to embed our ancient constitutional \\nrights  in  a  more  certain  form  than  relying  on  conventions  which  have  been  tested  and  strained, \\nindeed they have been tested only this week. \\nIn  the  first  year  I  will  ask  P&R  to  support  the  development  of  the  Community  Mental  Health \\n380 \\nCrisis & Support Centre.  \\n385 \\nI am personally  committed to strengthening the bonds across  the Islands. In the first quarter \\nand  twice  yearly  thereafter  I  will  visit  Alderney  to  strengthen  the  common  interest  between  our \\nIslands and to reduce the tension in handling our shared challenges. \\nI will also initiative formal quarterly meetings with the Presidents. The meetings will have a single \\nclear  purpose  to  ensure  that  each  Committee  is  pulling  its  weight  but  is  also  receiving  enough \\nsupport  to  deliver  its  part  in  Revive  and  Thrive  action  plans  to  improve  communications  and \\nunderstanding between P&R and all Members, effective immediately. Any Member will be welcome \\nto attend meetings of P&R. \\nI welcome feedback on my leadership so in the first quarter and quarterly thereafter I will meet \\n390 \\nif desired with each Member of the States. \\n395 \\n400 \\nThose in the last States know that, whether we agree or not, I treat everyone with professional \\ncourtesy and respect in all my dealings. I will always stop and listen and my proverbial door is always \\nopen to meet any Member at any time and in any location. \\nMy professional relationships and career required trust, mutual respect, and considered analysis. \\nYou can trust that I say what I mean and I will do what I say. While I never seek conflict, I am not \\nafraid of it, as I have demonstrated when responding head on to threats from outside the Island. \\nYou will have observed this year I am calm in a crisis. I believe, no matter what the issues, having \\nboth vision and strategy, knowing where you aim to get to and how are key, as is flexing but working \\nto a plan to ensure you actually deliver. If you do not maintain that discipline, vision, strategy and \\nplanning, you just end up with a lot of hot air and no action.  \\nYou know I have a strong track record of delivery, you know that I represent the Island well and \\nwith dignity, you know that I provide continuity and experience. I have set out comprehensively my \\nplans for change – not change for change's sake but purposeful change, including how we can all \\nwork more decisively and more effectively together. That is what Guernsey voted for. \\n405 \\nI am so excited. Let's get on with it, let's do this together, and that is why, with humility, I seek \\nto be the President of the Policy & Resources Committee. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Thank you very much. \\nMembers of the States, we are now on the verge of starting up to 30 minutes of questioning of \\n410 \\nthe two candidates. \\nPerhaps if people want to ask questions they can hand in their name to the Sheriff and the other \\nstaff within the Assembly. Can I invite the two Alderney Representatives, if they wish to, to occupy \\nthe seats with microphones now that were vacated by the two candidates. \\n415 \\nAnyone else? There is a couple at the back, please. Like drawing a raffle, isn't it? \\nSo I am going to remind you all that questions are limited to 30 seconds, replies are limited to \\none  minute,  and  that  we  alternate  each  question  between  the  two  candidates,  but  it  would  be \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n13 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache to answer first the first time round, that we will conclude at about 30 minutes, \\nand that it has to be a question within the policy listed in the mandate of the Policy & Resources \\nCommittee. \\n420 \\nWhat I am going to do is announce the first questioner and also the second questioner and then \\neach time draw another one out so that somebody is forewarned that it will be them up next. \\nThe first question will be asked by Deputy Le Tocq and the second  question will be asked by \\nDeputy de Lisle. It is now 10.41 and a bit and we will invite Deputy Le Tocq to place his question. \\n \\nDeputy Le Tocq: Thank you, Mr Bailiff. \\nWhat are the current major threats for the Bailiwick concerning the UK's withdrawal from the EU, \\nespecially regarding the final stages of negotiations taking place as we speak, and how would you \\nbe addressing these? \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: There are many. \\nThe current one is, I mentioned in my address, the hospitality sector, that question will remain \\nunresolved as we stand here and it will be difficult for people to move in and out of the Bailiwick. \\nWe have also got a threat to our financial services industry that will need to be resolved.  \\nHow will I resolve them? You resolve them by early and expeditious discussion with the British \\nauthorities.  You  also  attempt  to  resolve  them  by  early  and  expeditious  discussion  with  those  in \\nBrussels, equally are important. We need to stand up and we need to be strong and we need to … \\nthose are the two keys issues but there are many others and those are the issues that have been \\nhelpfully raised by Deputy Le Tocq because that is a crucial question: because of Covid, Brexit has \\nfallen into the nether regions really, rather than being in the prime as it would be. That is what we \\nneed to do. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy  St  Pier:  Sir,  the  main  problem  is  speed,  the  main  threat  is  the  speed  at  which  these \\nthings are progressing. We saw this in relation to the Free Trade agreement between the UK and \\nJapan  where  effectively  because  that  moved  at  such  a  pace,  we  did  not  participate  in  it  for  the \\npurposes of the trade and services and only for the purposes of goods. \\nSo that is the main challenge. I think everything is happening this week and next week we have \\ngot the fishing issue going on right now with the permissive extent clause being inserted in the UK's \\nFishing Bill that needs to be challenged immediately. If I am elected I will go back to my desk this \\nafternoon  and  start  lobbying  Members  of  the  House  of  Lords  to  ensure  that  that  amendment  is \\nreversed when it goes to the House of Lords. \\nThe main challenge is going to be enabling us to respond over the next 10 days or so as these \\nthings evolve at great pace in order that we can get the best position that we can before the deal \\nis closed.  \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Following Deputy de Lisle, the next questioner will be Deputy Dudley-Owen.  \\nBut first Deputy de Lisle. \\n \\nDeputy de Lisle: Thank you, sir. \\nGiven  the  concerns  of  the  last  Assembly,  how  do  you  intend  to  ensure  and  maintain  an  un-\\nfractious, collegiate and uniform Assembly? \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\n425 \\n430 \\n435 \\n440 \\n445 \\n450 \\n455 \\n460 \\n465 \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n14 \\n470 \\n475 \\n480 \\n485 \\n490 \\n495 \\n500 \\n505 \\n510 \\n515 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nDeputy St Pier: Sir, as I think I indicated in setting out my pitch, the first thing is to build a very \\ndifferent Policy & Resources Committee in the way that I suggested, so absolutely having a broader \\ncoalition of politic thought within Policy & Resources, but also increasing the mechanisms by which \\nthere is greater communication between Policy & Resources and the other Committees, and I again \\nset out the requirement for Members of Policy & Resources to participate in those inter-Committee \\npolicy  discussions,  which  are  so  dependent  on  being  able  to  marry  resources  with  what  the \\ncommittee is doing, and to ensure that everything is aligned, rather than Committees doing their \\nown thing, then suddenly finding there are no resources as required. \\nIt is about creating those channels of communication, so that there is a personal level from me \\none to one with each Member of this Assembly and by having Members of this Assembly present \\nin Policy & Resources to have a greater idea of the challenges and how it actually works within the \\nCommittee room. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache, please. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Speaking to people, getting to know people, listening to their views, have \\nyour  door  open,  have  your  phone  switched  on,  look  at  your  email,  even  look  at  your  Facebook \\nwhich I have now entered for the first time in the 21st century. Do all those kind of things, be readily \\navailable, because the more you speak to people the more you understand them, the more you can \\nseek to persuade them that they may be wrong, the more that they can seek to persuade you that \\nyou may be wrong. There is no magic in it, it is communication, communication and communication. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: After Deputy Dudley-Owen, the next questioner will be Deputy Prow. \\nBut first Deputy Dudley-Owen, please. \\n \\nDeputy Dudley-Owen: Thank you, sir. \\nHow do the candidates plan to handle the cross-over of certain policy areas such as transport \\nbetween Policy & Resources and Economic Development? There are other examples I could give \\nbut not in the time available. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: By the two Committees speaking to each other.  \\nAgain this is not intended as a criticism of anybody, because I was a Member of our States and \\nI share my own degree of responsibility.  \\nBy  forgetting  your  mandate.  I  know  the  Bailiff  has  told  us  we  can  only  speak  abut  Policy  & \\nResources today in relation to questions, but forgetting your mandate and speaking and saying to \\nEconomic Development via the President, what are the issues, how do we deal with the points that \\nDeputy Dudley-Owen has just raised, how can we address them in an effective way? \\nI  think  it  goes  beyond  just  Economic  Development  and  P&R;  it  includes  STSB  for  example \\nbecause of their responsibilities in relation to certain matters. So that is the way you would do it: \\nagain collaboration and discussion. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy  St  Pier:  That  is  an  excellent  question  and  a  very  pertinent  and  real  one.  It  is  as  I \\nsuggested, picking up the recommendations from the States report into the governance of Policy \\n&  Resources  at  the  beginning  of  this  year,  which  obviously  got  overtaken  by  Covid  and  actually \\nhaving Members of Policy & Resources present with the other Committees when they are discussing \\nissues which are cross-Committee, understanding what those issues are, particularly where you have \\ngot  three  Committees  involved  –  which  does  happen  with  things  like  the  Children  and  Young \\nPeople’s Plan, for example, where you need greater involvement. That is effectively ensuring that \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n15 \\n520 \\n525 \\n530 \\n535 \\n540 \\n545 \\n550 \\n555 \\n560 \\n565 \\n570 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nyou have the Civil Service working to the same model, where senior civil servants are present from \\none Committee to another who need to have the political alignment in that fashion as well, that will \\nhelp us ensure that we have got all Committees working to the same agenda and that we marry the \\nresources to allow them to actually deliver the agreed agenda for the States of Guernsey as a whole. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Following Deputy Prow's question, it will be Deputy Matthews. \\nSo Deputy Prow first, please. \\n \\nDeputy Prow: Thank you, Mr Bailiff. \\nMy question relates to the mandate of P&R in relation to duties 3 to 5 in the Red Book which \\nconcerns  its  relationship  with  all  the  other  Committees  that  are  tasked  to  deliver  services  to  the \\npublic. Currently there is no formal constitutional mechanism for all the  Committee Presidents to \\ndiscuss and progress cross-Committee policy. Do the candidates agree that this can tend to make \\nStates dysfunctional and inhibits a more collaborative and collective system of Government? \\nThank you, sir. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier.  \\nDuring the last term I initiated a process of informal meetings of the Presidents and that was not \\neffective, which is why I put the emphasis when I spoke on having formal meetings but having it \\nwith a purpose which is about the deliver of the common objective, mainly the priority of Revive \\nand Thrive.  \\nSo it is not just a meeting,’ a nice chat, so what?’, but actually it is very much focused on delivery. \\nThe challenge also is ensuring that the Presidents are also able to represent their entire Committees \\nbecause again with the hope that we will have Committees that have much broader political thought \\nwe  also  need  to  make  sure  that  the  full  view  of  the  Committee  is  represented  when  you  bring \\nPresidents together. That is another major challenge which again is why it is important that P&R \\nactually goes into those Committees rather than just interact President to President, because the \\ndialogue is much greater than just President to President.  \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Well, sir, we have got agreement,  I absolutely agree with what Deputy St \\nPier has just said and he did try to initiate informal meetings; I was one of those that was willing to \\nattend but there were many others that were not.  \\nWe  need  to  discuss  matters,  we  need  exactly  what  Deputy  St  Pier  said  when  a  President  sits \\ndown once a month or once every three months, whichever system emerges – whether it is the St \\nPier or the Ferbrache system – when you do that, President of Education, President of Environment, \\nPresident of Health, they must have the support of their Committees, so that you are talking to the \\nheads of that Committee so that you are getting a view, so that you can represent views, because \\nwhat we would like to do, whether it is Environment or whoever, when they bring a policy letter is \\nfor P&R to say we have fully discussed it, we agree with it or we have got these reservations which \\nwe have expressed. Again communication. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: So following Deputy Matthews’ question, it will be Deputy Haskins. \\nDeputy Matthews, please. \\n \\nDeputy Matthews: Thank you, sir. \\nGiven that the previous Education, Sport & Culture Committee had felt constrained to operate \\nwithin a budget, I would like to ask what the approach might be in this States should some of the \\noptions prove to be more expensive or any other options from any other Committees?  \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n16 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nDeputy  Ferbrache:  That  is  a  really  excellent  question  and  we  will  know  when  we  resolve  the \\neducation question, which we have got to resolve very quickly. \\nMy own view, but it would be for the States’ view for the 40 people that sit in this room, my own \\nview  is  that  the  public  overwhelmingly  want  a  three-school  model  that  will  cost  some  money  in \\nrelation to both capital investment but probably less than the money that would be addressed if it \\nwas a two-school model.  \\nBut it goes beyond that because Deputy Matthews’ question also talked about the sport and the \\nculture aspects. Those are very important parts of our community, those are very important parts \\nof what we do. Education is always going to be expensive, we have got to make sure we get value \\nfor money and we have got to make sure that we achieve the goals that we have not been able to \\nachieve in recent years which is education excellence. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy St Pier: It is a great question and clearly a very relevant one that this States is going to \\nface in this term. \\nI think we need to move so far beyond ideology here, we need the next Committee for Education, \\nSport & Culture, I hope it will be led by Deputy Dudley-Owen, to bring back the report from the \\npause and review process with a pragmatic solution that is capable of winning support from the \\ncommunity, from the profession and from a majority in this Assembly. It will not be unanimous we \\nknow that.  \\nIt  is  P&R's  responsibility  at  that  point  to  ensure  that  whatever  the  agreed  solution  is  is  then \\ndelivered for value for money. That is the issue. It is not constraining the solution with a budget, \\nlet's discern what is the most appropriate solution delivering the best educational outcomes and \\nthen ensure that we deliver it with value for money that is P&R's role and that is what we need to \\ndo in this next term. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: So after Deputy Haskins the following questioner will be Deputy Leadbeater. \\nDeputy Haskins, please. \\n \\nDeputy Haskins: Thank you, sir. \\nThe electorate clearly voted for change and clearly thought that not enough was progressed, so \\nironically I would like to ask essentially the same question that Deputy Lester Queripel asked in the \\n2016  election  contest.  What  will  you  do  differently  to  ensure  that  policies  and  strategies  do  not \\nsimply sit on a shelf and are progressed? \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy St Pier: I think the question really is about ensuring that the States of Guernsey have an \\nagreed set of priorities and my proposal is that it is Revive and Thrive, that becomes what will drive \\nthe work of all Committees, and therefore you are not going to have Committees doing their own \\nthing  which  suddenly  they  find  they  cannot  be  funded  and  cannot  be  delivered.  So  that  is  the \\ndifference; that is the change that we must have. \\nThe Policy & Resource Plan was the first attempt to try and achieve that. It did not achieve all \\nthat was intended of it, we have got a much clearer focus now post-Covid in terms of the recovery \\nplan that will enable us to deliver what is required. I am very confident of that because of the work \\nthat has been done and because of the proposals as to how we can get the Committees to work \\ntogether  with  P&R  having  much  closer  involvement  in  the  development  of  policy  within  a \\nCommittee and between Committees which is so critical. \\n575 \\n580 \\n585 \\n590 \\n595 \\n600 \\n605 \\n610 \\n615 \\n620 \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n17 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Perhaps the first element of a slight discord but gently discord between the \\n625 \\ntwo candidates, because visions and strategies are important, but action is what is required. \\n630 \\n635 \\n640 \\n645 \\n650 \\n655 \\n660 \\n665 \\n670 \\n675 \\nWe could tomorrow spend £30 million, as we should do in early course without overheating the \\nconstruction industry, on repairing the Harbour, which has been neglected over a number of years. \\nWe could do the Cow’s horn, we could do the other things, we could do practical things tomorrow. \\nA friend of mine once said in relation to a £30,000 job at the Airport some years ago, before I \\nbecame President of STSB – I am sure it would have happened if I had been President of STSB – a \\n40-page  tender  document,  So  somebody  did  not  tender  for  it,  because  they  were  a  Guernsey \\ncompany, they were not going to say whether an employee had a conviction for drink driving five \\nyears ago. As a result an English company tendered, they got the job, they sub-contracted it to the \\nGuernsey company who got £20,000 and they got £10,000 on top – complete nonsense. We have \\ngot to get rid of that and do something practical, rather than just vision and Revive and Thrive, and \\ntalking about it. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: That is your minute. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Thank you, sir, sorry. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: After Deputy Leadbeater's question, it will be Deputy Inder. \\nDeputy Leadbeater, please. \\n \\nDeputy Leadbeater: Thank you, sir. \\nMy question is not too dissimilar to those of Deputies de Lisle and Prow. What would you do as \\nPresident  of  P&R  to  foster  cross-Committee  working  and  ensure  that  no  rifts  develop  between \\nCommittee Presidents such as we have seen in previous times? \\nThank you. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Again I think a good question, it builds on, as he says, previous questions. \\nTalking to people, discussing things, making sure if you can that when the President, whether he or \\nshe comes to a meeting with whoever the President of P&R is or their colleagues, they have got the \\nconsensus view of that Committee so that you know … There is no point you agreeing something \\nwith the President today and he or she goes off tomorrow and that view does not come through. It \\nhappened in relation to the Home department in my view, in relation to the review of the Population \\nManagement Law – that was something that could have been dealt with better, without criticising \\nanybody. \\nSo again it is talking to people. I keep repeating myself but that is the way you can do it, get to \\nknow people and talk to them. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy St Pier: I think a key objective for this Assembly over the next 10 days is to ensure that \\neach  Committee  is  built  with  a  broader  spectrum  of  political  thought  than  happened  in  2012  or \\n2016. In both of those periods effectively the presidential victor actually took all, in the sense that \\nthey then nominated their four Committee Members and largely they got what they asked for, we \\nthen had largely homogenous thought within that Committee. \\nI think if we had broader political thought actually there would be more robust discussion when \\nproposals come to this Assembly or come to P&R for funding. They will have been more robustly \\nchallenged,  that  is  another  key  element  of  ensuring  that  we  can  be  more  effective  and  actually \\nproduce  decisions  which  we  are  all  capable  of  adhering  to  and  actually  delivering  which  is  so \\nimportant. \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n18 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Following Deputy Inder's question, the next questioner will be Deputy Brouard. \\nSo Deputy Inder, please. \\n \\nDeputy  Inder:  Candidates,  public  service  reform  has  not  been  mentioned  by  any  candidate \\neither in manifesto, I believe, or certainly not in speeches. \\nWhat would either candidate do in the first six months to halt the expansion of the States and \\nfast track commissioning of services to the third parties and or the charitable sector? \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy St Pier: Sir, I appreciate that I was reading at some pace in my speech, but I did refer to \\npublic service reform (Interjection) and I did indicate that in week one, we need to appoint a political \\nlead for public service reform who will drive that agenda. That is absolutely critical. The progress so \\nfar has been certainly in the last year or so has been focused around the outsourcing of IT and the \\nAgilisys contract.  \\nThere  is  so  much  more  that  needs  to  be  done  but  it  is  absolutely  critical,  if  we  are  going  to \\nensure that we can balance our budgets in the next five years, that we actually do deliver the change \\nand the transformation in the public service. That has to be politically owned, it has to ultimately be \\nowned by Policy & Resources and we need a political lead for it within that Committee, and I will \\nappoint that in the first week.  \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Six months is too long, six days is too long. Remember a statistic, those of \\nyou who were in the States last time: in the last four years, the number of States' senior employees \\nearning between £80,000 and above went up from 226 to 325. That has happened in the last four \\nyears.  \\nHow many people in the private sector earn more than £80,000 a year? Very few, and they have \\ngot stringent and detailed targets to meet. So we need to do it. We have talked about it. We have \\ndone very little. We need to be sitting down with senior civil servants and say, ‘Come up with it; if \\nyou cannot come up with it you may be looking for other positions somewhere else to deal with it.’ \\nWe have got to be as dramatic as that because we have not grasped the issue that annoys the \\npublic writ large. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Following Deputy Brouard, it will be Deputy Dyke. \\nSo Deputy Brouard, please. \\n \\nDeputy Brouard: Thank you, sir. \\nWill social and environmental policy have to take a back seat while economic policy is prioritised \\nout of necessity? \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Mrs Thatcher, not always popular but a great Prime Minister, said you cannot \\nspend money until you have earned it – her quote was more eloquent than that. Because we cannot \\npay for anything unless we get our economy right. We can beat our chests, we can say we are going \\nto do this, we can have a five-hour debate on something that we have got no chance in a million \\nyears of implementing. But of course social policy is important because that is what we are here for. \\nWhen  people  say  Guernsey  is  a  business,  it  is  a  business  but  it  is  a  business  with  a  social \\nconscience. It has got to deal with environmental issues, it has got to deal with social issues. So they \\nare important. \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n19 \\n680 \\n685 \\n690 \\n695 \\n700 \\n705 \\n710 \\n715 \\n720 \\n725 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nBut unless you can pay your bills, everything else is secondary. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy  St  Pier: It is critical that the  economic, social  and  environmental  policies are seen as \\nbeing  absolutely  interconnected  and  intertwined.  The  economy  is  absolutely  critical  as  Deputy \\nFerbrache says, but it is understanding the interrelationship between them.  \\nI referenced for example home energy efficiency. Actually those kind of schemes enable us to \\nput money into the economy into those of small traders. It actually has an environmental benefit \\nbut also has a social benefit and produces equity as well – social equities for those that are unable \\nto keep themselves warm in winter, particularly the elderly. \\nSo  that  is  a  really  good  example  of  something  that  actually  you  can  see  the  interconnection \\nbetween them all, it has an economic benefit and a environmental benefit and a social benefit as \\nwell.  \\nThere are dozens of other examples, like when you start to think about active travel and those \\nkind of initiatives as well: the economic advantage and the health advantage and the savings for \\nthe Government are in those kind of initiatives. So that is the change we need to have – \\n \\nThe Bailiff: That is you minute, I am afraid, Deputy St Pier.  \\nFollowing Deputy Dyke, Deputy Gollop will be posing a question. \\nDeputy Dyke please. \\n \\nDeputy Dyke: Thank you, sir. \\nCould I ask the candidates what they would propose to reduce the regulation and bureaucracy \\nthat is holding back our economy and our Bailiwick? \\nThank you. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy  St  Pier:  The  prospect  of  red  tape  is  one  that  is  always  waved  around  as  if  there  is \\nsomething that can be waved around. I think there are some areas. The Guernsey Financial Services \\nCommission was reviewed a number of years ago. I think the Economic Development Committee \\nmight want to think about whether there is any area that needs to be looked at there. \\nSome of our planning rules: I think in particular actually being more permissive, particularly when \\nyou are dealing with developments within the curtilage of a property and those things which are \\nexempt from planning application at all. Those are the kind of things that I think we could readily \\ndeal with. \\nThe Open Market Law: we have introduced in 2017 a whole bunch of regulation around who can \\nand cannot live in an Open Market property. As I referenced when I spoke that is an area where I \\nwould seek to remove some regulation as well.  \\nSo I think it  can be done area by area. Much if it sits  within  Committees, Planning, Economic \\nDevelopment are in a very good position to help drive some of that – \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Your minute is up, Deputy St Pier. \\nDeputy Ferbrache, please. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: In my up to day, day job which will change, because it will not exist after \\ntoday if I am elected, I have dealt with planning over many years. The planning regime is like running \\nthrough treacle, you find common sense solutions which are precluded by rule whatever it is of the \\nIDP, we have got a SLUP which is out of date and is completely unnecessary in the planning process. \\nAlso  we  need  to  speak  to  the  Guernsey  Financial  Services  Commission,  which  is  an  independent \\n730 \\n735 \\n740 \\n745 \\n750 \\n755 \\n760 \\n765 \\n770 \\n775 \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n20 \\n780 \\n785 \\n790 \\n795 \\n800 \\n805 \\n810 \\n815 \\n820 \\n825 \\n830 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nbody, and say, ‘Could you be a little bit more helpful in relation to people who want to do business \\nin this Island. Could you be a little more proactive?’  \\nGenerally think about regulation before we enact it. Some of it is forced upon us and we can do \\nnothing about it in relation to international regulations if we want to operate in the real world, but \\nthere is a lot of it we could just say no to or we could take the slow boat to China, rather than the \\nfast bus to St Peter Port. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Following Deputy Gollop's question, it will be Deputy de Sausmarez. \\nDeputy Gollop please. \\n \\nDeputy Gollop: Thank you. \\nFollowing on Deputy Brouard's question, for a balanced Assembly to move forward without flip-\\nflopping,  what  are  the  candidates’  views  on  the  effective  but  appropriate  implementation  of \\ndisability,  equalities  and  anti-discrimination \\nlegislation \\nimportantly,  reasonable \\nadjustments to the practical to help people and businesses? \\nincluding, \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy  Ferbrache:  All  of  us  who  were  Members  of  the  last  Assembly  signed  up  to  that \\nunanimously as we should and as we did. We need to be practical. \\nI  remember  four  years  ago  both  Deputy  St  Pier  and  I  said  genuinely  that,  in  relation  to  the \\nDisability Strategy, that should be a prime thing. Very little happened over the last four years, very \\nlittle. So we are better to do things we can do a little bit than try and do everything which we will \\nnot do. We are an inclusive society, we are all equal, but we have to realise that we should also be \\npractical. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy  St  Pier:  The  key  to  the  next  stage  is  communication  between  the  Committee  for \\nEmployment  &  Social  Security  and  the  various  business  groups  and  their  representatives  and \\nactually business directly to actually develop a programme of implementation that is practical and \\npragmatic and works. The political direction exactly as Deputy Ferbrache said is very clear and the \\nwill of the States is clear implementation is now key that can be done by agreement, but it requires \\na lot of involvement and dialogue between Government and those that are affected.  \\n \\nThe Bailiff: After Deputy de Sausmarez's question, it will be Deputy Soulsby. \\nDeputy de Sausmarez please. \\n \\nDeputy de Sausmarez: Thank you, sir. \\nCan each candidate please set out their experience relevant to the role of Chair of the CCA? \\n \\nThe Bailiff: I am going to disallow that question because it is not strictly within the mandate of \\nthe Policy & Resources Committee, so Deputy Soulsby please. \\n \\nDeputy Soulsby: I hope this one is, but I am not quite sure. \\nAs  P&R  President,  you  will  be  Chair  of  the  Civil  Contingencies  Authority.  Do  you  believe  the \\napproach since the beginning of the pandemic to manage Covid has struck the right balance or do \\nyou have a different risk appetite?  \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Let me just call a pause, a timeout effectively on this. \\nMadam Procureur, Mr Comptroller, depending on which one wants to answer this, we have had \\ntwo questions now relating to the Civil Contingencies Authority. I know that ex-officio the President \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n21 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\nof the Policy & Resources Committee chairs the Civil Contingencies Authority, but it is not strictly, \\nin my reading of the Rules relating to question time for a presidency, within the mandate of the \\ncommittee for which the election is being held. \\nDo you have a view please? \\n \\nThe Procureur: Sir, yes I do, and I think it is summed up really in your first sentence. The holding \\nof the Chair is ex-officio as President of the Policy & Resources Committee and therefore in my view \\nit is not part of the mandate of the Committee, sir. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: All right. \\nWe  will  resume  the  timing.  I  have  got  Alderney  Representative  Snowdon  as  the  next  one, \\nfollowed by Deputy Murray. \\nSo I am going to ask now, with the clock restarting effectively, Alderney Representative Snowdon, \\nplease. \\n \\nAlderney Representative Snowdon: Thank you, sir. \\nWith staycation bringing the Islands together, which has been a fantastic to see,  how will the \\nnew P&R team Committee strengthen relationships between Alderney and Guernsey over the next \\nfour years? \\nThank you. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy St Pier: As I said when I spoke for me personally … I will take a personal interest. I will \\ncome to the Island within the first quarter and then commit to come twice a year during the rest of \\nthe term. \\nI think it is incredibly important we have the 1948 Agreement which needs to be reviewed but I \\nthink  we  can  do  it  in  the  spirit  of  much  greater  connectiveness  than  we  have  had  for  several \\ngenerations.  So  I  think  the  spirit  and  the  willingness  of  both  communities  to  work  together  is \\nfantastic. There are some shared challenges, for example the support for the airline and the travel \\nconnections with the Island, but I think it requires us to actually be boots on the ground. \\nI also want to have more Alderney representation within the States of Guernsey Committees and \\nin particular I spoke about how we get a greater voice for Alderney at the top table for P&R and \\nhow we get input of Alderney issues so that P&R is better informed about some of the challenges \\nwhen it is making decisions that affect Alderney. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Alderney has not been looked after at all in the last four years in any material \\nway, despite the words that may have been uttered. I think I have shown myself in the last four years \\nto be a friend of Alderney and I will continue to be a friend of Alderney. We need to speak to the \\npoliticians in Alderney. We need to have regular contact with them, we ought to listen to what they \\nhave to say, we ought to appreciate their difficulties. \\nNow, they are not always the most united bunch, the States of Alderney, but we ought to try \\nand pour gentle words into sometimes troubled ears. But liaise with the people of Alderney, liaise \\nwith their political representatives.  \\n \\nThe Bailiff: After Deputy Murray, there will be a question from Deputy Falla. \\nDeputy Murray please. \\n \\nDeputy Murray: Thank you, sir. \\n835 \\n840 \\n845 \\n850 \\n855 \\n860 \\n865 \\n870 \\n875 \\n880 \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n22 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\n885 \\n890 \\n895 \\nI do not want to exercise the candidates for too long, because I am looking for a yes or no answer \\nto this. Would the candidates make a commitment to ensure that the 2012 decision of the States \\nto make the introduction of International Public Sector Standards is brought to fruition during this \\nterm of the States? Yes or no. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache: \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Deputy Murray wants a yes or no answer. Yes. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy St Pier: Yes. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: After Deputy Falla, it will be Deputy Trott. \\nDeputy Falla, please. \\n \\nDeputy Falla: Thank you, sir. \\nDo you enjoy a good working relationship with the other Crown Dependencies and how do you \\n900 \\nenvisage that going forward? \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy  St  Pier:  Yes,  it  is  absolutely  critical  that  we  work  very  closely  with  the  other  Crown \\nDependencies.  I  have  a  regular  dialogue  with  both  my  opposite  numbers.  I  have  been  speaking \\nweekly with both the Chief Ministers for the Isle of Man and Jersey, particularly during the pandemic, \\nbut of course it has not just been pandemic-related issues dealing with the things like the sanctions \\nand  Anti-Money  Laundering  Bill,  dealing  with  the  Brexit  negotiations  ensuring  we  are  aligned \\nactually  is  one  of  the  biggest  diplomatic  challenges  for  any  leader  of  the  Policy  &  Resources \\nCommittee.  \\nWe often think about the dialogue that is required within our own Assembly, but actually when \\nyou  need  to  ensure  that  you  are  carrying  other  jurisdictions  with  you,  that  is  one  of  the  key \\nchallenges that I have had over the last four years in dealing with issues, whether it is with Brussels \\nor with the UK, there cannot be a chink between us, and there often are issues that do need to be \\nironed out behind closed doors – that needs to continue. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: When I was in the States many years ago, I was President of the Board of \\nIndustry and Member of the Advisory & Finance, I had regular dealing with my colleagues in Jersey \\nand  in  relation  to  carrying  that  forward.  Of  course  as  Deputy  St  Pier  said,  those  are  absolutely \\nparamount and we will need to work together.  \\nBut what we must establish with those other jurisdictions is that we are equal partners, our views \\ncarry equal weight, and our interests are equal to theirs. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: After Deputy Trott's question, there will be a question from Deputy Helyar. \\nDeputy Trott, please. \\n \\nDeputy Trott: Sir, thank you. \\nCan  I  ask  the  candidates  what  limitations  or  shortcomings  do  you  see  in  yourselves  that  you \\nwould seek to make up for through your choice of P&R Members? \\n905 \\n910 \\n915 \\n920 \\n925 \\n930 \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n23 \\n935 \\n940 \\n945 \\n950 \\n955 \\n960 \\n965 \\n970 \\n975 \\n980 \\n985 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Well, sometimes I can be a little intemperate so I would seek to eradicate \\nthat. It is going to be a little bit difficult because I have been like that probably all my life but equally \\nI think that I would seek to invite comments and wisdom and judgement from other people because \\nanybody that thinks that they have got all the judgement, all the wisdom, and all the knowledge is \\na fool, and whatever else I may be, and I have so many failings I could not list them in the next three \\nhours if I was here, I do not think I am a fool.  \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy St Pier: I think my wife is in the Gallery so I will go to the opening of an envelope. I am \\ninterested in too much, so I participate in too many things that people ask me to participate in, so \\ndelegation is key and I think certainly, as I indicated when I spoke, I have already got some thoughts \\nabout how we do that within P&R so that we have the responsibility allocated for different functions \\nfor the employer function, for liaison for the policy areas with other Committees, obviously external \\nrelations, the  Treasury function. I think that is what I would do differently for a second term and \\nstarting at 9.15 a.m. on Tuesday the first meeting of P&R will be to agree that, working on the skill \\nsets of the people that we have around that table which as I say needs to be broadly drawn from \\neverybody in this Assembly today with a broad political thought.  \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Helyar I think this is going to be the last question now. \\n \\nDeputy Helyar: Thank you, sir. \\nI have a question about leadership. As a new Member it feels as if I have just walked into a turf \\nwar, perhaps a re-run of Hamlet. Will both candidates commit to working together constructively, \\nnotwithstanding the outcome of this election? \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy St Pier. \\n \\nDeputy St Pier: Yes. \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Deputy Ferbrache. \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: Yes, sir. \\nDeputy St Pier is an able, decent, good man who has committed himself over the last eight years \\nand the last four years as leader. Of course.  \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Well, that is the 30 minutes up, allowing for the pause in the middle. I think in the \\ncircumstances,  Members  of  the  States,  you  might  wish  to  show  your  appreciation  for  the  two \\ncandidates. (Applause)  \\nNow, Members of the States, we come to the vote. It is by way of a secret ballot. There are two \\ncandidates to choose between, that is: Deputy Ferbrache proposed by Deputy Dudley-Owen and \\nseconded by Deputy Prow; and Deputy St Pier proposed by Deputy Roffey and seconded by Deputy \\nCameron.  \\nWhat I am going to invite you to do is to take the voting slip in front of you and simply write \\neither Ferbrache or St Pier on it – more if you prefer but that will suffice. Please do not write anything \\nelse on your voting slip because if there is more than the name of the candidate it will be treated \\nas a spoilt ballot paper. The voting slips once they are prepared can be folded in half and handed \\nto one of the parliamentary officials, HM Sheriff. \\nI suggest that unless anyone is desperate to get up and stretch their legs because it will not take \\nlong to count two piles that we simply stay in our seats and relax for a moment. So can you make \\nsure that the voting slips are ready to be handed to HM Sheriff and the Usher. \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n24 \\nSTATES OF DELIBERATION, FRIDAY, 16th OCTOBER 2020 \\n \\n \\nA secret ballot took place. \\n \\nThe  Bailiff:  Members  of  the  States,  I  have  been  handed  the  record  of  the  votes  cast  in  the \\nelection for a President of the Policy & Resources Committee. \\nDeputy  Ferbrache  polled  23  votes,  Deputy  St  Pier  17  votes,  and  therefore  I  declare \\nDeputy Ferbrache duly elected to that office. (Applause) \\nBefore we close this meeting is there anything you would wish to say, Deputy Ferbrache? \\n \\nDeputy Ferbrache: I am grateful to those who voted for me. I fully respect the votes of those \\nthat did not vote for me. \\nWhat I would say is that Deputy St Pier has served this Island, this Bailiwick, commendably well \\nover the last eight and a bit years. I hope and I trust, because he is a man of such integrity, ability \\nand experience,  that  he  will continue to  serve this Island well over the next  four  years and eight \\nmonths. I would welcome working with him; he is a very good person. \\n990 \\n995 \\nI thank all of you. We have now got, as Deputy St Pier said, the most difficult passage of time \\nbefore us that probably any Government has had for many years. Let's go and do it, and let's do it \\nwell. \\n1000 \\n \\nThe Bailiff: Well, Members of the States, I am going to ask the Greffier to close the meeting in \\na moment with the Grace and we will be back, largely in the same places, tomorrow morning. \\nGreffier please. \\n \\nThe Assembly adjourned at 11.23 a.m. \\n______________________________________________________________________________________ \\n25 \\n\""
